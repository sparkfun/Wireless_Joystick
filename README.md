The SparkFun Wireless Joystick Kit is a customizable XBee wireless controller with a SAMD21 at the heart of the board. The controller can be configured in two ways; gamepad or dual-stick. The gamepad has a layout similar to the SNES gamepad, with a single joystick on the left and four push-buttons on the right, and two trigger buttons. The dual-stick configuration uses two analog joysticks, along with two trigger buttons. Dual joysticks are perfect for tank-steering robotics; the left joystick controls the motor(s) on the left side, and the right  joystick controls the motor(s) on the right side.
